Our research on centrosome amplification in epithelial ovarian cancer cells
is now available on [bioaRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.28.550973v1). 
In this [paper](/assets/publi/Edwards_et_al_2023_Centrosome_amplification.pdf), 
we show that centrosome amplification favors responses to conventional 
chemotherapy independently of multipolar divisions and chromosome instability.
